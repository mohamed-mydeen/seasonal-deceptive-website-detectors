You are a senior cybersecurity engineer and hackathon mentor.

Help me build a hackathon-level project titled:

-----------------------------------------------------------
| "Seasonal Fake Offer & Phishing Website Detection System" |  
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem:
During festivals like New Year and Diwali, attackers create fake offer websites that promise free gifts and ask users to share links. These sites are used for deception and monetization.

Requirements:
- 100% FREE and open-source tools only
- No HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
- Frontend must be built using Streamlit (Python only)
- Backend logic in Python
- Cybersecurity-focused approach
- Explainable output (why a site is fake)

Core Features:
1. URL pattern analysis (length, suspicious keywords, domain extension)
2. Domain age verification using WHOIS
3. HTTPS and SSL certificate validation using Python built-in libraries
4. Web page content analysis to detect scam phrases
5. Risk scoring engine (0–100) with clear classification:
   - Safe
   - Suspicious
   - Fake / Phishing
6. Streamlit UI showing:
   - Risk score
   - Status (Safe / Fake)
   - Reasons for classification

Deliverables:
- Clean project folder structure
- Python module-wise code
- Hackathon-ready demo flow
- README.md content
- Resume-ready project description
- Viva / judge explanation points

Constraints:
- No paid APIs
- No cloud services
- Must run locally
- Beginner-friendly but hackathon-quality

Guide me step-by-step and explain the logic clearly.
